Sketch 1 was drawn by Katie Nicolato and shows the envisioned viewshed analysis portion of the project that indicates a GUI and a viewshed analysis map over the area of interest. Sketchs 2-3 were drawn by Bryan Begay, while sketch 4 was a drawn by both Katie Nicolato and Bryan Begay. Sketches 2-4 show the point clouds iterating through various stages of the final project. With sketch 2 showing a basic potree visualization with the point cloud overlaid on a open street map base map. Sketch 3 shows the point cloud visualization with a cesium ion base map that displays the terrain. Lastly, sketch 4 shows the final potree visualization with the point cloud ontop of the cesium ion basemap with some tools like height profile and a viewpoint pin to indicate a viewshed analysis tool.
